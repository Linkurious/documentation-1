# the Ogma theme

This is the Ogma theme:
it consists of underscore templates and a few assets: a [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
theme and [basscss](https://basscss.com/) as a basic CSS framework.

This is NOT bundled by default in documentation: it is NOT the default theme.

The contents are the following:

- `index._`, the main template that defines the document structure
- `section._`, a partial used to render each chunk of documentation
- `assets/*`, any assets, including CSS & JS
